Any garbage collector has a few essential tasks that it has to do periodically:

1.  Identify live/dead objects
2.  Recycle/reuse the memory occupied by dead objects
3.  Compact/defragment memory (optional)

These tasks can be performed in sequence or can be arbitrarily(in a way that is based on chance rather than
being planned or based on reason) interleaved(mix by alternating between them).

A straight-forward approach is to pause JavaScript execution and perform each of these tasks in sequence on the
main thread. This can cause jank and latency issues on the main thread,
which we’ve talked about in [Jank Busters Part One · V8 EN](./Jank-Busters-Part-One), [Jank Busters Part Two Orinoco · V8](Jank-Busters-Part-Two) , as well as reduced program throughput.

**There are two types of Garbage Collector**

## Two Types of Garbage Collector

### 1\. Major GC (Full Mark-Compact)

The major GC collects garbage from the entire heap.

Major GC happens in three phases: marking, sweeping and compacting.

#### Marking

Figuring out which objects can be collected is an essential part of garbage collection. Garbage collectors do this by using reachability as a proxy for ‘liveness’. This means that any object currently reachable within the runtime must be kept, and any unreachable objects may be collected.

  height="404"
  alt="Image"
/>

Marking is the process by which reachable objects are found. The GC starts at a set
of known objects pointers, called the **root set**. This includes the execution stack
and the global object.

It then follows each pointer to a JavaScript object, and marks that object as reachable. The GC follows every pointer in that object, and continues this process recursively, until every object that is reachable in the runtime has been found and marked.

#### Sweeping

Sweeping is a process where gaps in memory left by dead objects are added to a data structure called a free-list. Once marking has completed, the GC finds contiguous gaps left by unreachable objects and adds them to the appropriate free-list.

The sweeping in this context is not just collecting the dead objects after marking process it's rather focus on reusability using free-list.

Free-lists are separated by the size of the memory chunk for quick lookup. In the future when we want to allocate memory, **we just look at the free-list and find an appropriately sized chunk of memory rather than requesting a new page of memory**.

  width="718"
  height="404"
  alt="Image"
/>

#### Compaction

The major GC also chooses to evacuate/compact some pages, based on a fragmentation heuristic(in the *sense that practice indicates it is a good enough solution*, while theory indicates that there are better solutions).

You can think of compaction sort of like hard-disk defragmentation on an old PC. We copy surviving objects into other pages that are not currently being compacted (using the free-list for that page). This way, we can make use of the small and scattered gaps within the memory left behind by dead objects.

  width="718"
  height="404"
  alt="Image"
/>

One potential weakness of a garbage collector which copies surviving objects is that when we allocate a lot of long-living objects, we pay a high cost to copy these objects. This is why we choose to **compact only some highly fragmented pages**, and just perform sweeping on others, which does not copy surviving objects.

**Dive in to more**

Major GC in V8 starts with concurrent marking. As the heap approaches a dynamically computed limit, concurrent marking tasks are started. The helpers are each given a number of pointers to follow, and they mark each object they find as they follow all references from discovered objects.

Concurrent marking happens entirely in the background while JavaScript is executing on the main thread. [Write barriers](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2025255) are used to keep track of new references between objects that JavaScript creates while the helpers are marking concurrently.

<Image
  src="/Jank-Busters-Part-Three/09.svg"
  width="718"
  height="404"
  alt="Image"
/>

The major GC uses concurrent marking and sweeping, and parallel compaction and pointer updating.

When the concurrent marking is finished, or we reach the dynamic allocation limit, the main thread performs a quick marking finalization step. The main thread pause begins during this phase. This represents the total pause time of the major GC. The main thread scans the roots once again, to ensure that all live objects are marked, and then along with a number of helpers, starts parallel compaction and pointer updating.

Not all pages in old-space are eligible for compaction — those that aren’t will be swept using the free-lists mentioned earlier. The main thread starts concurrent sweeping tasks during the pause. These run concurrently to the parallel compaction tasks and to the main thread itself — they can continue even when JavaScript is running on the main thread.

## Generational layout

The heap in V8 is split into different regions called [generations](https://v8.dev/blog/orinoco-parallel-scavenger). There is a young generation, and an old generation. Young generation is split further into ‘nursery’ and ‘intermediate’ sub-generations.

**We have three different ages in Objects**

1.  **Nursery**  
     When you first create object the object goes to the nursery. Which also means that Objects are first allocated into the nursery.

      height="404"
      alt="Image"
    />
2.  **Intermediate**: If they survive the next GC, they remain in the young generation but are considered ‘intermediate’.
3.  **Old generation**: If they survive yet another GC, they are moved into the old generation.

#### Why We focus on the object that moves?

The V8 heap is split into generations. Objects are moved through generations when they survive a GC.

In garbage collection there is an important term: “The Generational Hypothesis”. This basically states that most objects die young. In other words, most objects are allocated and then almost immediately become unreachable, from the perspective of the GC. This holds not only for V8 or JavaScript, but for most dynamic languages.

V8’s generational heap layout is designed to exploit this fact about object lifetimes. The GC is a compacting/moving GC, which means that it copies objects which survive garbage collection.

This seems counterintuitive: copying objects is expensive at GC time. But we know that only a very small percentage of objects actually survive a garbage collection, according to the generational hypothesis. **By moving only the objects which survive, every other allocation becomes ‘implicit’ garbage. This means that we only pay a cost (for copying) proportional to the number of surviving objects, not the number of allocations.**

### 2. Minor GC (Scavenger)

There are two garbage collectors in V8. The **Major GC (Mark-Compact)** collects garbage from the whole heap. The **Minor GC (Scavenger)** collects garbage in the young generation. The major GC is effective at collecting garbage from the whole heap, but the **generational hypothesis tells us that newly allocated objects are very likely to need garbage collection**.

Think Minor GC as a racoon. it scavenges(clean) the trashcan right? So Racoon is the scavenger. It likes fresh? or new trash rather than rotten old trash.

  width="718"
  height="404"
  alt="Image"
/>

Each thread receives a number of pointers, which it follows, eagerly evacuating any live objects into To-Space.

In the Scavenger, which only collects within the young generation, surviving objects are always evacuated to a new page. V8 uses a ‘semi-space’ design for the young generation. **This means that half of the total space is always empty,** to allow for this evacuation step.

<Image
  src="/Jank-Busters-Part-Three/Drawing 2023-10-22 13.58.05.light.png"
  width="718"
  height="404"
  alt="Image"
/>

During a scavenge, this initially-empty area is called ‘To-Space’. The area we copy from is called ‘From-Space’. In the worst case, every object could survive the scavenge and we would need to copy every object.

For scavenging, we have an additional set of roots which are the old-to-new references. These are pointers in old-space that refer to objects in the young generation. Rather than tracing the entire heap graph for every scavenge, we use [write barriers](https://www.memorymanagement.org/glossary/w.html#term-write-barrier) to maintain a list of old-to-new references.

When combined with the stack and globals, we know every reference into the young generation, without the need to trace through the entire old generation.

The evacuation step moves all surviving objects to a contiguous chunk of memory (within a page).

**This has the advantage of completing removing fragmentation - gaps left by dead objects**.

We've done our marking phase pretend these arrows coming in the left or all our references from the stack and the global object then we know we're in the nursery and these are the live objects we're going to deal with it.

1.  Switch the label into "from-space" and "to-space"

<Image
  src="/Jank-Busters-Part-Three/Minor GC 1.light.png"
  width="718"
  height="404"
  alt="Image"
/>

2. Evacuate the all the objects that survived from GC. Put the mark on it cuz to
   know this objects were alive from one GC time.

  src="/Jank-Busters-Part-Three/Minor GC 1 1 1.light.png"
  width="718"
  height="404"
  alt="Image"
/>

3.  The pointers have to update based on the object location that already moved

  src="/Jank-Busters-Part-Three/Minor GC 1 1 1 1.light.png"
  width="718"
  height="404"
  alt="Image"
/>
4. Change "to-space" round, so the "to-space" would be Nursery again.

<Image
  src="/Jank-Busters-Part-Three/Minor GC 1 1 1 1 1.light.png"
  width="718"

  width="718"
  height="404"
  alt="Image"
/>

5.  So the next GC would be like this, cuz we put the mark on it. So that the it goes to Old generation. And the new object would go to the "to-space"
    <Image
      src="/Jank-Busters-Part-Three/Minor GC 1 1 1 1 1 1 1.light.png"

In scavenging we actually do these three steps — **marking, evacuating, and pointer-updating** — all interleaved, rather than in distinct phases.

The scavenging tasks have to synchronize via atomic read/write/compare-and-swap operations when trying to evacuate an object; another scavenging task may have found the same object via a different path and also try to move it. Whichever helper moved the object successfully then goes back and updates the pointer.

##### 1. Atomic read/write/compare-and-swap operations:

> Atomic?: "Atomic" in this context means operations that run completely independently of any other operations and are uninterruptible. Once they start, they run straight through without being stopped, altered, or interfered with.

- **Read/Write**: An atomic read or write ensures that the data is fully read or fully written in one go without the risk of another thread reading/writing to it midway.
- **Compare-and-swap (CAS)**: CAS is an atomic operation that does the following:
  1.  Compares the current value of a memory location with a given value.
  2.  If the current value is equal to the given value, it modifies the memory location to a new specified value.
  3.  CAS is often used in algorithms that synchronize multiple threads. It's a way to ensure that only one thread can change a value from a known old value to a new value.

It leaves a forwarding pointer so that other workers which reach the object can update other pointers as they find them. For fast synchronization-free allocation of surviving objects, the scavenging tasks use thread-local allocation buffers.

##### 2\. Thread-local allocation buffers (TLAB):

> **Thread-local**: This means that the data or resource is local to a specific thread and not shared among other threads. Each thread has its own instance of the resource.

> **Allocation Buffer**: It's a reserved space in memory where objects can be allocated.

So, a "thread-local allocation buffer" is a reserved space in memory where a specific thread can allocate objects without interference from other threads. This setup has a significant advantage: since the allocation buffer is local to the thread, the thread doesn't need to lock or synchronize its operations with other threads when allocating objects. This makes allocation fast and avoids potential contention or slowdowns that could occur if multiple threads were trying to allocate objects in a shared space simultaneously.

Parallel scavenging distributes scavenging work across multiple helper threads and the main thread.

Orinoco is the codename of the GC project to make use of the latest and greatest parallel, incremental and concurrent techniques for garbage collection, in order to free the main thread. There are some terms here that have a specific meaning in the GC context, and it’s worth defining them in detail.

## Terminology for Orinoco

**Purpose of Orinoco**  
The Orinoco effort was to transfer a purely sequential garbage collector into mostly concurrent and parallel garbage collector(with incremental backup) and the whole goal is to **Free the main thread**.

#### Parallel GC

parallel is probably the easiest way to move some work off the main thread this is where your main thread and your helper threads do some work at the same time.

- Main thread + helper threads do equal work at the same time
- Still 'stop-the-world' - no JS runnning(Main thread pause)
- Reduces the atomic pause by a factor N("atomic pause" refers to the pause or stoppage of application execution, Atomic: A task that's indivisible and uninterruptible. Once it starts, it continues to completion without being stopped or interfered with.)

Js runtime is not single threaded. But the total pause time is now divided by the number of threads participating (plus some overhead for synchronization). This is the **easiest** of the three techniques. The JavaScript heap is paused as there is no JavaScript running, so each helper thread just needs to make sure it synchronizes access to any objects that another helper might also want to access.

<Image
  src="/Jank-Busters-Part-Three/05.svg"
  width="718"
  height="404"
  alt="Image"
/>

The main thread and helper threads work on the same task at the same time.

#### Incremental

incremental in terms of our GC is where we take an amount of garbage collection work that has to be done and we split it into little pieces and we sort of sprinkle(to scatter a few drops or small pieces of something) it in between the JavaScript

<Image
  src="/Jank-Busters-Part-Three/Pasted image 20231023140503.png"
  width="350"
  height="404"
  alt="Image"
/>

Incremental is where the main thread does a small amount of work intermittently(something that starts, then stops, then starts up again). We don’t do an entire GC in an incremental pause, just a small slice of the total work required for the GC.

**This is more difficult, because JavaScript executes between each incremental work segment, meaning that the state of the heap has changed, which might invalidate previous work that was done incrementally.**

As you can see from the diagram, this does not reduce the amount of time spent on the main thread (in fact, **it usually increases it slightly),** it just spreads it out over time. This is still a good technique for solving one of our original problems: main thread latency.

By allowing JavaScript to run intermittently(at irregular intervals; not continuously or steadily), but also continue garbage collection tasks, the application can still respond to user input and make progress on animation.

<Image
  src="/Jank-Busters-Part-Three/06.svg"
  width="718"
  height="404"
  alt="Image"
/>

Small chunks of the GC task are interleaved(mix (two or more digital signals) by alternating between them) into the main thread execution.

#### Concurrent

Concurrent is when the main thread executes JavaScript constantly, and helper threads do GC work totally in the background.

**This is the most difficult of the three techniques: anything on the JavaScript heap can change at any time,** invalidating work we have done previously. On top of that, there are now read/write races to worry about as helper threads and the main thread simultaneously read or modify the same objects.

The advantage here is that the main thread is totally free to execute JavaScript — although there is minor overhead due to some synchronization with helper threads.

<Image

/>

GC tasks happen entirely in the background. The main thread is free to run JavaScript.

## State of GC in V8

#### Reality of Garbage Collection

Many years ago V8 Garbage Collection looks like this. But how about now?(2019)

<Image
  src="/Jank-Busters-Part-Three/01.svg"
  width="718"
  height="404"

/>

**Parallel Scavenging(introduced on 2019)**

<Image
  src="/Jank-Busters-Part-Three/08.svg"
  width="718"
  height="404"
  alt="Image"
/>

We use Scavenging in Parallel. We use up to 7 helper threads so the main thread and 7 helper threads would split the work into eight parts we kick up all these threads at the same time and we do evacuation and marking so in in scavenging we actually interleave all of these phases at the same time so we do the marking the evacuation and the pointer updating all at the same time

## Idle-time GC

Users of JavaScript don’t have direct access to the garbage collector; it is totally implementation-defined. V8 does however provide a mechanism for the embedder to trigger garbage collection, even if the JavaScript program itself can’t. The GC can post ‘Idle Tasks’ which are optional work that would eventually be triggered anyway. Embedders like Chrome might have some notion of free or idle time. For example in Chrome, at 60 frames per second, the browser has approximately 16.6 ms to render each frame of an animation. If the animation work is completed early, Chrome can choose to run some of these idle tasks that the GC has created in the spare time before the next frame.

<Image
  src="/Jank-Busters-Part-Three/10.svg"
  width="718"
  height="404"
  alt="Image"
/>
Idle GC makes use of free time on the main thread to perform GC work proactively.

## Takeaways

Most developers don’t need to think about the GC when developing JavaScript programs, but understanding some of the internals can help you to think about memory usage and helpful programming patterns. For example, with the generational structure of the V8 heap, short-lived objects are actually very cheap from the garbage collector’s perspective, as we only pay for objects that survive the collection. These sorts of patterns work well for many garbage-collected languages, not just JavaScript.
