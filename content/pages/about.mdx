Hi I'm Merlin and currently study about frontend development.

## Welcome, Visitors!

This blog is for those who are comfortable using English. As a Korean, it's my first language, but I'm doing my best to use English as fluently as native speakers. So, please be understanding of any mistakes.
In this blog, I'll be discussing various skills and theories related to front-end development. Welcome aboard!
